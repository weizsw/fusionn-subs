I need you to research and evaluate these AI models for English→Chinese subtitle translation quality.

Available free models on OpenRouter:
{{range $index, $model := .Models}}- {{$model.ID}} ({{$model.ContextLen}} tokens)
{{end}}
Evaluation criteria (in order of importance):
1. Translation quality: Accurate, natural Chinese output
2. Instruction following: Must use exact format (#1 Translation> pattern)
3. Consistency: Stable output across batches
4. Context handling: Can process subtitle context effectively
5. Reliability: Low error rate, handles edge cases

Requirements:
- Avoid code-focused models (optimized for programming, not natural language translation)
- Must work well with Chinese language (some models have better CJK support)
- Must follow structured output formats reliably
- Prefer models with larger context windows for better coherence

---
IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY the model ID, exactly as shown in the list above.
DO NOT include explanations, reasoning, analysis, or additional text.

Format: provider/model:free OR provider/model

Examples:
{{if .Models}}- {{(index .Models 0).ID}}
{{if gt (len .Models) 1}}- {{(index .Models 1).ID}}
{{end}}{{end}}
